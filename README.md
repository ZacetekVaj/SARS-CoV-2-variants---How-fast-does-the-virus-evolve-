# Homework 4: SARS-CoV-2 variants - How fast does the virus evolve?

Viruses are not immune to mutations and evolution.
During the pandemic, the SARS-CoV-2 virus mutated, evolved, and changed its characteristics, leaving us with various new strains and variants.


The evolution of new strains is tied to their rate of mutation.
Therefore, we must know how fast they mutate to understand their evolution.
Their mutation rate is meaningless without some references; thus, we will compare it to the rate of mutations of other viruses.
Apart from the rate, the location of mutations is vital for evolving new characteristics while preserving their viability.
Some specific mutations give rise to a new variant, and we will be interested in where those mutations happen in different variants.
Lastly, we will focus on Slovenia and its variant landscape throughout the pandemic.
